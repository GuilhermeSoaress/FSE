CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/yan/yan/projetos/ESP-IDF/sensorTemperatura+mqtt/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/yan/yan/projetos/ESP-IDF/esp-idf/examples/protocols/mqtt/tcp/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/yan/yan/projetos/ESP-IDF/sensorTemperatura+mqtt/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/yan/yan/projetos/ESP-IDF/esp-idf/examples/protocols/mqtt/tcp/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
